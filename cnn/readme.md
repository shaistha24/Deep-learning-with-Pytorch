# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Includes course work related to Convolutional Layer, Creating a Filter, Edge Detection, Maxpooling Layer, and projects- CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 database and Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST.

**Multi-Layer Perceptron, MNIST**

Train an MLP to classify images from the MNIST database hand-written digit database.

The process will be broken down into the following steps:

- Load and visualize the data

- Define a neural network

- Train the model

- Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!


**CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 database**
Using: 

- Convolutional layers, which can be thought of as stack of filtered images.

-  Maxpooling layers, which reduce the x-y size of an input, keeping only the most active pixels from the previous layer.

- The usual Linear + Dropout layers to avoid overfitting and produce a 10-dim output.
